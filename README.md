## My Favorite TV Shows on Netflix
- The Flash (CW)
- Suits (USA)
- Mr. Robot

CW's The Flash is one of the highlights of my pandemic. I zoomed past through the seasons averaging around 3.5 days per season and caught up to the current timeline in which I decided to just give the show some time to finish the season and come back when I'm done doing the same with other shows.
Suits, an amazing TV Series produced by the USA Network featuring Patrick Adams (as Mike Ross), a genius with fake law credentials that is working under Gabriel Macht (as Harvey Specter) - a charismatic and self-centric attorney which hired Mike Ross under the condition that only they know about his secret. I won't spoil too much but let's just say don't watch some episodes with a kid or with someone **at all**.
Mr. Robot, a series I did not finish as at the time, my subscription ran out and I didn't have money to bring it back again. Overall, the few seasons I've laid my eyes on has been an amazing experience so far - different mixes of the real world under the eyes of Rami Malek (as Elliot Alderson). Elliot is a computer hacker so at the time of the show's release, it really appealed on me but it took me 2 years to finally watch the show as we didn't have that good of an internet access back then.
